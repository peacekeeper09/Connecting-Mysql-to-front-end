# Connecting-Mysql-to-front-end

Recently I suffered a bit while I was asked to make a front-end project with my database, I don't want any of my junior or co-worker to face the same hence am dropping this here. 


## About the situation I faced.

The database I was asked to use was MySQL workbench and in front-end we had any option to choose. I basically prefer front end so it was a bit hectic to me to choose a language to connect the backend. Anyways without any further dues, let's begin with the project!
